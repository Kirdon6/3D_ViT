# Protein-Ligand Binding Site Detection using 3D Vision Transformers

## Description

The detection of protein-ligand binding sites is not only an important tool for understanding the function of proteins but also finds application in computer-aided drug design in the detection of molecules capable of perturbing protein function. The prediction methods can be divided into sequence-based and structure-based. Similarly, as with images, 3D space can be voxelized, and generalized machine learning methods such as 3D convolutional networks can be used applied for the detection of the binding sites. Recently, a method was published that allows the so-called attention mechanism to be applied to the field of computer vision - Vision Transformer (ViT). The goal of the work is to evaluate the possibilities of extending ViT to 3D, i.e., 3D ViT, for protein-ligand binding sites detection. The work will include a comparison of the implemented approach with existing approaches for protein-ligand binding sites detection.
